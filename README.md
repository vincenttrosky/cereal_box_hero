## Summary

This project uses Q-Learning and SARSA reinforcement learning algorithms to solve 9x9 mazes. Download the Q-Learning or SARSA file of your choosing. Each file has two versions.

Version 1:
Version 1 of this code runs the model and returns the final maze solution.

Version 2:
Version 2 is intended to provide better analysis of the algorithm's convergence rate.
